Diff from traditional databases like MySQL in several ways. 
Here's a simple comparision 

1.data format: 
While traditional db stores data in table format, which consist of rows and col, 
mongodb stores data in json format(key, value pairs) 
Ex: {Name: "vidya", Age: 31}

2.Schema: 
TD db has fixed structure, monogodb can have diff fields.

3.Relationships: 
allows us to create relationship by simply nesting the dttata(embedding related data
directly), td db requires normalization and then using joins to link them togeather.
