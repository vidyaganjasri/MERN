# Semantic and Non-Semantic Elements in HTML

Semantic elements provide **meaning** to the content they enclose. They help structure a web page by dividing it into logical sections, each serving a specific purpose.

## Examples of Semantic Elements

- **`<h1>`**: Main heading of the page.
- **`<nav>`**: Navigation links; can appear multiple times.
- **`<hr>`**: Thematic break between sections.
- **`<header>`**: Wraps the top section of a page; usually contains title and subtitle. Only **one main header** per page.
- **`<main>`**: Contains the primary content. There should be **only one `<main>`** per page.
- **`<footer>`**: Bottom section of the page; only **one footer** per page.
- **`<section>`**: Groups related content.
- **`<article>`**: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
- **`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`**: Represent lists.

> ✅ Semantic elements improve accessibility and SEO.

## `aria-labelledby`

- Used to improve accessibility by associating a label with a region or element.

## Non-Semantic Elements

- **`<div>`**: Block-level container with no specific meaning.
- **`<span>`**: Inline container with no meaning; useful for styling specific words or phrases.

> ⚠️ Use semantic elements whenever possible to make your HTML more readable and meaningful.
